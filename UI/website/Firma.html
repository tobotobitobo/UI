                <h2>This Project</h2>
                <p>
                    The overarching objective of this project is to develop a robust system for detecting and classifying objects within
                    images captured by a camera. This involves not only identifying the presence of objects but also precisely
                    determining their type and spatial characteristics, including their position and size within the image frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary motivation for developing accurate object detection and classification capabilities was to
                    enable the creation of a virtual agent capable of navigating through a simulated gridworld maze.
                    This agent will utilize a pre-trained machine learning model or agent specifically designed to
                    solve maze-like challenges.
                </p>
                <h3>Potential Applications and Future Directions</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Autonomous Robotics: The system can be integrated into autonomous robots for tasks such as 
                            exploration, search and rescue, and material handling in industrial settings.
                        </li>
                        <li>Augmented Reality (AR): The object detection and classification capabilities
                            can enhance AR experiences by overlaying virtual objects onto real-world scenes, creating more immersive and interactive environments.
                        </li>
                        <li>Computer Vision Research: The project can serve as a foundation for further
                            research in computer vision, particularly in the areas of object recognition, scene understanding,
                            and visual navigation.

                <h2>Models</h2>
                <h3>YOLO</h3>
                <p>
                    A single-stage detector that divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from the grid cells. Prioritizes speed, making it ideal for real-time applications like video surveillance or self-driving cars.
                </p>
                <h3>SSD</h3>
                <p>
                    A single-stage detector that uses a feature pyramid to detect objects at multiple scales. Offers a good balance between speed and accuracy, suitable for applications where both factors are important
                </p>
                <h3>Faster R-CNN</h3>
                <p>
                    A two-stage detector. It first generates region proposals (potential bounding boxes) and then classifies and refines these proposals. Best for applications where the highest possible accuracy is the primary goal, even if it means sacrificing some speed.

                <h2>Dataset</h2>
                <p>The dataset contains a total of 890 different photos on which  we want to recognize 3 main  classes of objects: finish,
                    robot, and obstacle, where an obstacle is any object other than the target or the robot.
                </p> 
                <h3>Future development</h3>
                <p>
                    Our dataset has the potential for further expansion. Increasing its size could significantly 
                    improve the accuracy and reliability of our models. The goal is to achieve a more comprehensive 
                    and representative dataset that better reflects real-world conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our dataset should be capable of identifying any obstacle, excluding the robot and finish itself.
                    This means the dataset should be continuously expanded to include a wide variety of
                    obstacles that the robot may encounter in its environment.

                <h3>Roboflow Trainig</h3>
                <p>To gain valuable insights and establish a baseline, we trained our model not only using our 
                    own infrastructure but also on Roboflow's cloud platform. This allowed us to directly
                     compare the performance and training outcomes achieved on Roboflow with those obtained
                      from our own training setup.</p>

                <h2>Evaluation</h2>
                <p>We trained our model on both our own infrastructure and Roboflow's cloud platform.
                    By comparing the val-box-loss, training-box-loss, and mAP 50-95 graphs from both
                    platforms, we were able to gain valuable insights into the model's performance
                    and identify potential areas for improvement. These graphs provide a visual
                    representation of how well our model is learning to localize objects in images.</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li><b>val-box-loss graph:</b> This graph shows the average loss (error) associated with the bounding
                        box predictions on a validation set. A decreasing trend in this
                        graph indicates that the model is improving its ability to localize objects.</li>
                    <li><b>training-box-loss graph:</b> This graph shows the average loss associated with the bounding
                         box predictions on the training set.
                          A decreasing trend in this graph indicates that the model is learning.</li>
                    <li><b>mAP 50-95 graph:</b> This graph shows the mean Average Precision (mAP) at different Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds between 0.5
                        and 0.95. mAP is a widely used metric for
                        evaluating object detection models.
                        A higher mAP value indicates better overall performance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Analysis of the val-box-loss, training-box-loss, and mAP 50-95 graphs
                    revealed minimal performance differences between models trained
                    on our local setup and Roboflow's cloud platform. The primary
                    distinction observed was that training on the server required significantly more time.
